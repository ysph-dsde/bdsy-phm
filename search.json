This time is intended to help you practice with peers who understand the type of study you conducted and give you an opportunity to implement any last-minute changes to improve your content.\nEach group will be given 25 minutes to present their slides followed by 5-10 minutes of peer-feedback. For the audience, provide feedback about:\n\nWhether the presentation was cohesive from start to finish and told a “story” about the study.\nHighlighted interesting findings unique to their data and hypothesis/research question.\nIf presenters clearly explained the takeaway from each slide and equally shared the responsibilities of presenting.\nWhether the group explained any shortcomings in their analysis, such as limitations imposed by the dataset’s original data collection methods.\nWhether the slides were light on text and effectively used visuals to communicate the core takeaways from each slide.\nWhether the presentation formatting was consistent enough to make the progression of information easy to follow. For example, ensuring serotypes are color-coded the same way in each figure.\n\nYou will then be mixed into groups of three people with one representative from each group. Each person will be given time to pull up their groups poster on their computer and give a 30 second to 1 minute elevator speech, or “hook”. Then explain some of the more detailed highlights you might provide someone who stops at your poster to hear more.\nFor poster visiters, practice asking questions from the perspective of someone from another project group. Provide feedback about:\n\nIf the primary 30-second to 1-minute “hook” is engaging and covers relevant points that encompass the study’s purpose and findings.\nHow easy it is to understand the project goals and conclusions if you have not conducted a similar study.\nThe effectiveness of the visualizations.\nWhether the poster is easy for casual browsers to understand, or if it requires a lot of focus to comprehend."

    "section": "Preamble",
    "text": "Preamble\nThis section is drawn from Dr. Weinberger’s recorded presentation What is ‘vaccine impact’?; and Administrative data: challenges and opportunities for evaluation studies 6.\nStatistical inference can be reduced to quantitatively answering three types of questions:\n\nCausation: Was there a change, and can we identify what caused the change?\nPrediction: What do we expect to see in the future?\nCertainty: How reliable are the answers to the first two questions?\n\nA biotechnologist developing a vaccine is primarily concerned with proving that there was a favorable change, such as mitigating the disease process in an individual. In contrast, a public health analyst aims to determine the overall impact of the vaccine on the population. For example, an effective vaccine not only protects an individual but also attenuates transmission within their immediate social circle.\nThis requires contextualizing the vaccine’s impact as a combination of direct and indirect effects. It is important to identify and control for unexplained linear and non-linear trends unrelated to the introduction of a vaccine to a population. For example, were there changes in overall population health at the same time or changes to diagnostic methods?\nWe can appreciate that this is a Sisyphean task, but one that can be addressed with time series analysis. Keep in mind that the methods discussed here are most applicable to endemic diseases that are consistently present in the population, existing at a relatively stable and predictable level. The core reason is that these methods require us to have an idea of what we would expect to have seen had the vaccine not been introduced, allowing us to posit a realistic counterfactual for model evaluation.\nOur study is framed by PICO. In black text are the general definitions for the acronym and in red text is the application to our example:\n\nPopulation: The target population where the impact of a vaccine is to measured. Children 2-59 months old.\nIntervention: The date and timeframe for a vaccine intervention. Introduction of PCV10 to the Brazilian national immunization program.\nComparator: Diseases or groups of diseases to compare against the intervention, which are not expected to be impacted by the intervention itself. Counterfactual to demonstrate what would have happened if the vaccine had not been introduced, compared to the factual scenario.\nOutcome: The condition representing our expected results from the intervention. Deaths due to pneumonia."

    "text": "Simple Linear Model\nTo correctly fit a simple linear model to the data, we need to apply a linearization that appropriately reflects its distribution. There are more analytical approaches to achieve this that will not be covered here. We start by visually examining the distribution with a scatter plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt is helpful to consider the data generation method, which can provide insights into the likely distribution.\n\n\n\np_base &lt;- \n  ggplot(df, aes(x = date, y = J12_J18_prim)) +\n      geom_point() +\n      labs(title = \"Deaths Scatter Plot\",\n         x = \"Date\", y = \"Counts for &lt;5 yo\") +\n      # Have y-axis for the two plots be the same.\n      ylim(0, NA) +\n      theme_linedraw()\n\np_base\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables that reflect counts (i.e., the number of deaths per month) can be distributed as either Poisson or negative binomial. Note that Poisson regression may artificially narrow confidence intervals when the data is overdispersed. To address this, you can use a negative binomial regression or a quasipoisson model, which accounts for the unexplained variation. In this context, we will apply a negative binomial regression.\n\n# For modeling, we need to use an ordered, discrete variable.

For instance, we know that infections have seasonal trends, sometimes referred to by its technical term periodicity. Additionally, our baseline population may change from 2005 to 2016, which can consequently shift the overall disease trend in tandem with these baseline changes."

This differs from the related concept of cyclicity, which represents recurring patterns that do not occur at regular intervals or consistently appear in regular seasons 9.\nEach seasonal pattern can be decomposed into three components that can either remain constant (stationary) or change over time (non-stationary): mean, variance, and covariance. The figure on the left illustrates the four possible seasonal trends separately. The top-left panel shows a recurring pattern with time-invariant, stationary parameters, while the other panels demonstrate the effects of non-stationary parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMost time series data in the natural sciences exhibit seasonality, periodicity, or cyclicity, though these patterns may be difficult to detect when the data is noisy 10.\n\n\nTo control for temporal variations such as seasonality, we employ a simple form of dynamic linear regression (DLR). Essentially, we add variables to our simple linear regression model that represents different subsections of time as new regressors. Applying a DLR allows for changes in the mean value of the underlying regression relationship 11. For the regression function to recognize each date, we need to factorize the date variable to assign the month the observation occured.\n\ndf$month &lt;- as.factor(month(df$date))\n\n# Inspect the first 36 entries.\ndf$month[1:36]\n\n [1] 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 1 \n[26] 2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12\nLevels: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\n\n# Update the model.\nmod2 &lt;- glm.nb(J12_J18_prim ~ date + month, data = df)\nsummary(mod2)\n\n\nCall:\nglm.nb(formula = J12_J18_prim ~ date + month, data = df, init.theta = 88.28907799, \n    link = log)\n\nCoefficients:\n              Estimate Std.

In epidemiology, it is standard to contextualize raw data by applying a denominator, or offset, that represents the population at risk of the disease.\nThe figure on the right illustrates how the baseline for the number of hospitalizations normalizes when we apply the population offset.

    "text": "Does the Disease Trend or Level Change?\nIn this section, we will test whether the trend or level of pneumonia deaths due to pneumococcal disease changes after the introduction of the PCV10 vaccine. To accomplish this, we will set up a counterfactual model to represent what our base model predicts the death counts would have been if the vaccine had not been introduced to the population. Similarly, a factual model will be applied to represent what actually happened with the vaccine rollout.\nWe will then compare the factual model against the counterfactual model to determine if a difference is identified in the period following vaccine introduction. This process is generally referred to as detecting vaccine effect or vaccine impact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nYou want to be careful when applying causal inference methods to model building, perturbation, or prediction questions. While our analysis uses a causal framework to detect the possible impact of the vaccine introduction, this does not permit us to make definitive claims of causation.\nAdditionally, it is important to remember that the model we have built may have other flaws influencing its sensitivity to the pre/post vaccination period. It is always best practice to test a model under different conditions and subject it to various tests to robustly justify its accuracy, precision, and generalizability.\n\n\nThe figure below illustrates the three phases of the vaccine rollout: pre-vaccination, post-vaccination, and a latency period between the start of vaccine distribution and efficacy evaluation. Recall that our base negative binomial model accounts for three effector variables: an ordered, discrete variable organizing the outcomes temporally without seasonality, the month to capture seasonal periodicity, and an offset to the baseline accounting for population changes. Our baseline model is expected to, and is therefore assumed to, detect the drop in average cases during the post-vaccination period.\n\n\n\nFigure by Dr. Dan Weinberger - From his recorded lecture Interrupted time series analysis 12.\n\n\nThis model, however, does not explicitly assign outcomes to the three phases represented in the figure. Therefore, we need to set up variables that distinguish outcomes before and after the vaccine introduction, as well as before and after the entry to the vaccine evaluation phase, in order to convert the base model into our factual and counterfactual models.\nWe also need to regenerate the model to produce factually-based and counterfactually-based predictions for comparison. There are three modeling approaches we will evaluate here, each employing a different method to define the pre/post and latency vaccination periods. These differences will impact our inference about vaccine effectiveness.\n\nInterrupted Time Series with Disconnected Segments: This method fits different line segments through the data and tests whether the slope or level of the disease changes. It can sometimes result in abrupt jumps when fitting the model.\nInterrupted Time Series with Connected Segments (Spline Model): This method allows the slope to change in the post-vaccine period but ensures the change is smooth.\nExtrapolation Based on the Pre-Vaccine Period: This method fits the model to data from the pre-vaccine period only and extrapolates the trend to the post-vaccine period.\n\n\nMethod 1. Interrupted Time Series with Disconnected Segments\nWe will add two new binary variables to our dataset: vax_intro and vax_eval. The vax_intro variable will be assigned a value of 0 before 2010-08-01 and 1 afterward; similarly, the vax_eval variable will be assigned a value of 0 before 2011-08-01 and 1 afterward.\n\n# Assign outcomes to the known vaccine phases.\ndf &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    vax_intro = ifelse(date &gt;= vax.intro.date, 1, 0),\n    vax_eval = ifelse(date &gt;= vax.eval.date, 1, 0)\n  )\n\n# View the changes by randomly selecting dates.\ndf[sort(sample(1:144, 10)), c(\"index\", \"date\", \"vax_intro\", \"vax_eval\")]\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 4\n   index date       vax_intro vax_eval\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;date&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1     1 2005-01-01         0        0\n 2     7 2005-07-01         0        0\n 3    42 2008-06-01         0        0\n 4    58 2009-10-01         0        0\n 5    74 2011-02-01         1        0\n 6    87 2012-03-01         1        1\n 7   104 2013-08-01         1        1\n 8   116 2014-08-01         1        1\n 9   123 2015-03-01         1        1\n10   125 2015-05-01         1        1\n\n\nIn linear modeling, it is common to include interaction terms. These terms allow the model to capture interdependencies between variables, showing how the effect of one variable on the outcome changes depending on the level of another variable. Interaction terms also enable the identification of synergistic effects, where the combined effect of two variables is greater (or less) than the sum of their individual effects 13.\nEquation 1 shows a multiple linear regression without an interaction term, and Equation 2 shows the inclusion of the interaction term. Notice that including the interaction term impacts the slope, making it dependent on the value of the other predictor. For example, the impact of X_1, holding X_2 constant, on the slope of Y is a function of (\\beta_1 + \\beta_3)\\ X_2 13.\n\\begin{align}\nY &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\epsilon\\\\\nY &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\beta_3 (X_1 \\times X_2) + \\epsilon\n\\end{align}\nWe will not spend more time discussing interaction terms but will briefly examine if they enhance the model’s predictive power. Note that while interaction terms can improve predictive accuracy, they also complicate the model and may result in a trade-off between predictive power and generalizability to other datasets.\nFirst we will generate the two models, then we will evaluate their performance side-by-side.\n\nNo Interaction Terms\nCreate a simple step-change model without an interaction term involving the newly added variables, vax_intro and vax_eval.\n\n# Additional seasonality controls covered in the collapsed box above.\nmod_method1a &lt;- glm.nb(J12_J18_prim ~ index + month + offset(log.offset) +\n                         # Change in disease during administration and \n                         # evaluation period.\n                         vax_intro + vax_eval, data = df)\n\nsummary(mod_method1a)\n\n\nCall:\nglm.nb(formula = J12_J18_prim ~ index + month + offset(log.offset) + \n    vax_intro + vax_eval, data = df, init.theta = 64.37470892, \n    link = log)\n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

By qualitative examination, it appears the model with interaction terms diverge more in the post-vaccination period.\nThe Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is a one measure used to compare the goodness of fit of different statistical models, while also accounting for model complexity. It helps in model selection by balancing model fit and complexity, otherwise called the bias/variance trade-off.\nThere are different variations of AIC, but the basic definition is\n\n\\text{AIC} = 2k - 2\\ln(\\mathcal{L})\n\nwhere k is the number of parameters in the model and \\mathcal{L} is the maximum likelihood of the model.\n\nAIC(mod_method1a, mod_method1b)\n\n             df      AIC\nmod_method1a 16 977.5948\nmod_method1b 18 980.4387\n\n\nThe results indicate that the AIC score is worse (higher) when interaction terms are included. Since there is no significant gain in performance, we will prefer the simpler model for better generalizability.\nBelow, we also observe that the interaction terms create unexpected trends in the factual/counterfactual ratio. Notably, the ratio is not 1 (indicating that factual and counterfactual predictions are the same) in the pre-vaccination period, which is not ideal.\n\n# Inspect methods sensitivity to vaccine impact.\np_ratio &lt;- \n  ggplot(df.pred.its, aes(x = date, y = rr.its.a)) +\n      geom_line() +\n      labs(title = \"Rate Ratio of the ITS Model\",\n         x = \"Date\", y = \"Rate ratio\") +\n      ylim(0, NA) +\n      geom_vline(xintercept = vax.intro.date, col = \"red\", lty = 2) +\n      annotate(\"text\", x = vax.intro.date + 30, y = 00.1, label = \"Vaccine Introduced\", color = \"red\", hjust = 0) +\n      theme_linedraw()\n\np_ratio +\n  geom_line(data = df.pred.its, aes(x = date, y = rr.its.b),\n            color = \"#4daf4a\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode Like a Pro\n\n\n\nWe won’t try to estimate a confidence interval on the rate ratio here. Students are encouraged to checkout the the InterventionEvaluatR package, which will automatically calculate the confidence intervals for these ratios.\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod 2. Interrupted Time Series with Connected Segments (Spline Model)\nIn this case, we force the changes to be smooth so that we don’t get a drastic jump after vaccination introduction that prematurly shows impact during the expected latency period. Therefore, we will add two new variables to our dataset: spl1 and spl2. The spl1 variable will be assigned a value of 0 before 2010-08-01 and index - intro.index + 1 afterward; similarly, the spl2 variable will be assigned a value of 0 before 2011-08-01 and index - eval.index + 1 afterward.\n\n# Identifies the row index that represents when the vaccine was introduced\n# and when the evaluation period started.\nintro.index &lt;- which(df$date == vax.intro.date)\neval.index  &lt;- which(df$date == vax.eval.date)\n\n# Assign outcomes to the known vaccine phases.\ndf &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    spl1 = ifelse(index - intro.index + 1 &lt; 0, 0, index - intro.index + 1),\n    spl2 = ifelse(index - eval.index + 1 &lt; 0, 0, index - eval.index + 1)\n  )\n\n# Inspect the changes.\ndf[sort(sample(1:144, 10)), c(\"date\", \"index\", \"spl1\", \"spl2\")]\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 4\n   date       index  spl1  spl2\n   &lt;date&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 2006-11-01    23     0     0\n 2 2009-02-01    50     0     0\n 3 2009-08-01    56     0     0\n 4 2009-11-01    59     0     0\n 5 2010-06-01    66     0     0\n 6 2011-01-01    73     6     0\n 7 2012-06-01    90    23    11\n 8 2013-05-01   101    34    22\n 9 2014-05-01   113    46    34\n10 2015-07-01   127    60    48\n\n\n\nmod_method2 &lt;- glm.nb(J12_J18_prim ~ index + month + offset(log.offset) +\n                        # Post-vaccine changes.\n                        spl1 + spl2, data = df)\n\nsummary(mod_method2)\n\n\nCall:\nglm.nb(formula = J12_J18_prim ~ index + month + offset(log.offset) + \n    spl1 + spl2, data = df, init.theta = 61.04668124, link = log)\n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

    "section": "Preamble",
    "text": "Preamble\nThis section is drawn from Dr. Weinberger’s recorded presentation What is ‘vaccine impact’?; and Administrative data: challenges and opportunities for evaluation studies 6.\nStatistical inference can be reduced to quantitatively answering three types of questions:\n\nCausation: Was there a change, and can we identify what caused the change?\nPrediction: What do we expect to see in the future?\nCertainty: How reliable are the answers to the first two questions?\n\nA biotechnologist developing a vaccine is primarily concerned with proving that there was a favorable change, such as mitigating the disease process in an individual. In contrast, a public health analyst aims to determine the overall impact of the vaccine on the population. For example, an effective vaccine not only protects an individual but also attenuates transmission within their immediate social circle.\nThis requires contextualizing the vaccine’s impact as a combination of direct and indirect effects. It is important to identify and control for unexplained linear and non-linear trends unrelated to the introduction of a vaccine to a population. For example, were there changes in overall population health at the same time or changes to diagnostic methods?\nWe can appreciate that this is a Sisyphean task, but one that can be addressed with time series analysis. Keep in mind that the methods discussed here are most applicable to endemic diseases that are consistently present in the population, existing at a relatively stable and predictable level. The core reason is that these methods require us to have an idea of what we would expect to have seen had the vaccine not been introduced, allowing us to posit a realistic counterfactual for model evaluation.\nOur study is framed by PICO. In black text are the general definitions for the acronym and in red text is the application to our example:\n\nPopulation: The target population where the impact of a vaccine is to measured. Children 2-59 months old.\nIntervention: The date and timeframe for a vaccine intervention. Introduction of PCV10 to the Brazilian national immunization program.\nComparator: Diseases or groups of diseases to compare against the intervention, which are not expected to be impacted by the intervention itself. Counterfactual to demonstrate what would have happened if the vaccine had not been introduced, compared to the factual scenario.\nOutcome: The condition representing our expected results from the intervention. Deaths due to pneumonia."

This differs from the related concept of cyclicity, which represents recurring patterns that do not occur at regular intervals or consistently appear in regular seasons 9.\nEach seasonal pattern can be decomposed into three components that can either remain constant (stationary) or change over time (non-stationary): mean, variance, and covariance. The figure on the left illustrates the four possible seasonal trends separately. The top-left panel shows a recurring pattern with time-invariant, stationary parameters, while the other panels demonstrate the effects of non-stationary parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMost time series data in the natural sciences exhibit seasonality, periodicity, or cyclicity, though these patterns may be difficult to detect when the data is noisy 10.\n\n\nTo control for temporal variations such as seasonality, we employ a simple form of dynamic linear regression (DLR). Essentially, we add variables to our simple linear regression model that represents different subsections of time as new regressors. Applying a DLR allows for changes in the mean value of the underlying regression relationship 11.

    "text": "Does the Disease Trend or Level Change?\nIn this section, we will test whether the trend or level of pneumonia deaths due to pneumococcal disease changes after the introduction of the PCV10 vaccine. To accomplish this, we will set up a counterfactual model to represent what our base model predicts the death counts would have been if the vaccine had not been introduced to the population. Similarly, a factual model will be applied to represent what actually happened with the vaccine rollout.\nWe will then compare the factual model against the counterfactual model to determine if a difference is identified in the period following vaccine introduction. This process is generally referred to as detecting vaccine effect or vaccine impact.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nYou want to be careful when applying causal inference methods to model building, perturbation, or prediction questions. While our analysis uses a causal framework to detect the possible impact of the vaccine introduction, this does not permit us to make definitive claims of causation.\nAdditionally, it is important to remember that the model we have built may have other flaws influencing its sensitivity to the pre/post vaccination period. It is always best practice to test a model under different conditions and subject it to various tests to robustly justify its accuracy, precision, and generalizability.\n\n\nThe figure below illustrates the three phases of the vaccine rollout: pre-vaccination, post-vaccination, and a latency period between the start of vaccine distribution and efficacy evaluation. Recall that our base negative binomial model accounts for three effector variables: an ordered, discrete variable organizing the outcomes temporally without seasonality, the month to capture seasonal periodicity, and an offset to the baseline accounting for population changes. Our baseline model is expected to, and is therefore assumed to, detect the drop in average cases during the post-vaccination period.\n\n\n\nFigure by Dr. Dan Weinberger - From his recorded lecture Interrupted time series analysis 12.\n\n\nThis model, however, does not explicitly assign outcomes to the three phases represented in the figure. Therefore, we need to set up variables that distinguish outcomes before and after the vaccine introduction, as well as before and after the entry to the vaccine evaluation phase, in order to convert the base model into our factual and counterfactual models.\nWe also need to regenerate the model to produce factually-based and counterfactually-based predictions for comparison. There are three modeling approaches we will evaluate here, each employing a different method to define the pre/post and latency vaccination periods. These differences will impact our inference about vaccine effectiveness.\n\nInterrupted Time Series with Disconnected Segments: This method fits different line segments through the data and tests whether the slope or level of the disease changes. It can sometimes result in abrupt jumps when fitting the model.\nInterrupted Time Series with Connected Segments (Spline Model): This method allows the slope to change in the post-vaccine period but ensures the change is smooth.\nExtrapolation Based on the Pre-Vaccine Period: This method fits the model to data from the pre-vaccine period only and extrapolates the trend to the post-vaccine period.\n\n\nMethod 1. Interrupted Time Series with Disconnected Segments\nWe will add two new binary variables to our dataset: vax_intro and vax_eval. The vax_intro variable will be assigned a value of 0 before 2010-08-01 and 1 afterward; similarly, the vax_eval variable will be assigned a value of 0 before 2011-08-01 and 1 afterward.\n\n# Assign outcomes to the known vaccine phases.\ndf &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    vax_intro = ifelse(date &gt;= vax.intro.date, 1, 0),\n    vax_eval = ifelse(date &gt;= vax.eval.date, 1, 0)\n  )\n\n# View the changes by randomly selecting dates.\ndf[sort(sample(1:144, 10)), c(\"index\", \"date\", \"vax_intro\", \"vax_eval\")]\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 4\n   index date       vax_intro vax_eval\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;date&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1    21 2006-09-01         0        0\n 2    27 2007-03-01         0        0\n 3    34 2007-10-01         0        0\n 4    42 2008-06-01         0        0\n 5    51 2009-03-01         0        0\n 6    74 2011-02-01         1        0\n 7    86 2012-02-01         1        1\n 8   101 2013-05-01         1        1\n 9   125 2015-05-01         1        1\n10   143 2016-11-01         1        1\n\n\nIn linear modeling, it is common to include interaction terms. These terms allow the model to capture interdependencies between variables, showing how the effect of one variable on the outcome changes depending on the level of another variable. Interaction terms also enable the identification of synergistic effects, where the combined effect of two variables is greater (or less) than the sum of their individual effects 13.\nEquation 1 shows a multiple linear regression without an interaction term, and Equation 2 shows the inclusion of the interaction term. Notice that including the interaction term impacts the slope, making it dependent on the value of the other predictor. For example, the impact of X_1, holding X_2 constant, on the slope of Y is a function of (\\beta_1 + \\beta_3)\\ X_2 13.\n\\begin{align}\nY &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\epsilon\\\\\nY &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\beta_3 (X_1 \\times X_2) + \\epsilon\n\\end{align}\nWe will not spend more time discussing interaction terms but will briefly examine if they enhance the model’s predictive power.

By qualitative examination, it appears the model with interaction terms diverge more in the post-vaccination period.\nThe Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is a one measure used to compare the goodness of fit of different statistical models, while also accounting for model complexity. It helps in model selection by balancing model fit and complexity, otherwise called the bias/variance trade-off.\nThere are different variations of AIC, but the basic definition is\n\n\\text{AIC} = 2k - 2\\ln(\\mathcal{L})\n\nwhere k is the number of parameters in the model and \\mathcal{L} is the maximum likelihood of the model.\n\nAIC(mod_method1a, mod_method1b)\n\n             df      AIC\nmod_method1a 16 977.5948\nmod_method1b 18 980.4387\n\n\nThe results indicate that the AIC score is worse (higher) when interaction terms are included. Since there is no significant gain in performance, we will prefer the simpler model for better generalizability.\nBelow, we also observe that the interaction terms create unexpected trends in the factual/counterfactual ratio. Notably, the ratio is not 1 (indicating that factual and counterfactual predictions are the same) in the pre-vaccination period, which is not ideal.\n\n# Inspect methods sensitivity to vaccine impact.\np_ratio &lt;- \n  ggplot(df.pred.its, aes(x = date, y = rr.its.a)) +\n      geom_line() +\n      labs(title = \"Rate Ratio of the ITS Model\",\n         x = \"Date\", y = \"Rate ratio\") +\n      ylim(0, NA) +\n      geom_vline(xintercept = vax.intro.date, col = \"red\", lty = 2) +\n      annotate(\"text\", x = vax.intro.date + 30, y = 00.1, label = \"Vaccine Introduced\", color = \"red\", hjust = 0) +\n      theme_linedraw()\n\np_ratio +\n  geom_line(data = df.pred.its, aes(x = date, y = rr.its.b),\n            color = \"#4daf4a\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode Like a Pro\n\n\n\nWe won’t try to estimate a confidence interval on the rate ratio here. Students are encouraged to checkout the the InterventionEvaluatR package, which will automatically calculate the confidence intervals for these ratios.\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod 2. Interrupted Time Series with Connected Segments (Spline Model)\nIn this case, we force the changes to be smooth so that we don’t get a drastic jump after vaccination introduction that prematurly shows impact during the expected latency period. Therefore, we will add two new variables to our dataset: spl1 and spl2. The spl1 variable will be assigned a value of 0 before 2010-08-01 and index - intro.index + 1 afterward; similarly, the spl2 variable will be assigned a value of 0 before 2011-08-01 and index - eval.index + 1 afterward.\n\n# Identifies the row index that represents when the vaccine was introduced\n# and when the evaluation period started.\nintro.index &lt;- which(df$date == vax.intro.date)\neval.index  &lt;- which(df$date == vax.eval.date)\n\n# Assign outcomes to the known vaccine phases.\ndf &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    spl1 = ifelse(index - intro.index + 1 &lt; 0, 0, index - intro.index + 1),\n    spl2 = ifelse(index - eval.index + 1 &lt; 0, 0, index - eval.index + 1)\n  )\n\n# Inspect the changes.\ndf[sort(sample(1:144, 10)), c(\"date\", \"index\", \"spl1\", \"spl2\")]\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 4\n   date       index  spl1  spl2\n   &lt;date&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 2005-11-01    11     0     0\n 2 2007-07-01    31     0     0\n 3 2010-05-01    65     0     0\n 4 2011-10-01    82    15     3\n 5 2012-04-01    88    21     9\n 6 2013-03-01    99    32    20\n 7 2013-08-01   104    37    25\n 8 2013-12-01   108    41    29\n 9 2014-06-01   114    47    35\n10 2016-07-01   139    72    60\n\n\n\nmod_method2 &lt;- glm.nb(J12_J18_prim ~ index + month + offset(log.offset) +\n                        # Post-vaccine changes.\n                        spl1 + spl2, data = df)\n\nsummary(mod_method2)\n\n\nCall:\nglm.nb(formula = J12_J18_prim ~ index + month + offset(log.offset) + \n    spl1 + spl2, data = df, init.theta = 61.04668124, link = log)\n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

Public health is an interdisciplinary field that measures and tracks disease trends and promotes health through policy and treatment interventions. We will investigate the impact of pneumococcal vaccines and the phenomenon of serotype replacement, where uncommon serotypes variations not targeted by the therapy flourish and take over as the predominant causes of disease after vaccination. Using data from infectious disease surveillance systems and statistical methods such as time series analysis, hierarchical modeling, and serotype clustering and association, we aim to understand serotype replacement and its implications. Our analyses will be conducted in R.\nOur objectives for this course will be to:\nWe will accomplish these objectives using data from national and multinational infectious disease surveillance systems, and the following statistical methods:\nFull project statement"

    "text": "Introduction\nReal-world analytical problems are often complex, making it difficult to define or derive deterministic solutions. Two common approaches to support complex analytical projects are:\n\nApproximating with a known solvable function.\nUsing stochastic search and optimization, such as Monte Carlo methods.\n\nWhile the first approach has many advantages, there are circumstances where approximating a problem with a known distribution is computationally prohibitive, overly reductive, or infeasible. In such cases, we leverage abstract probabilistic and statistical concepts to transform randomness into inferential statistics. When applied correctly, these concepts can surprisingly guarantee robust solutions to otherwise unsolvable problems.\nOne of these powerful techniques is Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Random samples generated with MCMC can be used for various purposes, including computing statistical estimates, numerical integrals, and estimating the marginal or joint probabilities of multivariate distributions and densities 1. Notably, MCMC provides a means to generate samples from joint distributions by utilizing conditional, factorized distributions 1,2.\nTwo common MCMC implementations are Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) and Gibbs sampling, with the latter being more accurately considered a special case of the former. Students are encouraged to explore M-H further on their own by reading the relevant sections of the supporting textbooks listed below. Today, we will focus on Gibbs sampling and only discuss M-H where it supports this learning, as Gibbs sampling is particularly well-suited for reducing high-dimensional problems into several one-dimensional ones 1,3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolid theory supports effective and accurate application!\n\n\n\nThe concepts discussed here have been compiled and summarized from various resources listed in the bibliography at the end of this page. We would like to specifically highlight the following textbooks, with suggested readings, to help students deepen their theoretical understanding of this week’s material.

    "text": "Distribution Estimation by Particle Sampling\n\n\n\n\nAbstraction of the introduction to Chapter 12 Particle-BasedApproximate Inference found in Probabilistic Graphical Models byKoller and Friedman. Points on the graph are only illustrativeof the variation in techniques 2.\n\n\n\nParticle-based methods approximate a multivariate distribution or network with a set of instantiations, referred to as particles, of some or all of the random variables in that distribution2. There are different flavors of this type of method illustrated on the right. Some particles are generated directly from an equation, while others are sampled from a distribution. Some particles represent all the variables in a distribution or network individually, while others assign a proxy variable that groups them 2.\nToday we are discussing one type of particle estimation: Gibbs sampling. In most cases, random variables are represented individually. However, readers should be aware that there are variations of Gibbs sampling that facilitate grouping the full set of random variables into “blocks”.\n\nRecall Markov Chains - A Stochastic Process\nThis section summarizes relevant concepts presented in Wasserman’s All of Statistics, specifically Chapter 23 3. Unless otherwise noted, the content comes from Wasserman’s All of Statistics.\nA stochastic process \\{X_t : t \\in T\\} is a collection of random variables taken from a state space, \\mathcal{X}, and indexed by an ordered set T, which can be interpreted as time. The index set T can be discrete, such as T = \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}, or continuous, such as T = [0, \\infty). To denote the stochastic nature of X, it can be written as X_t or X(t).\n\n\n\n\nIllustration of state transition diagram for the Markov chain 4.\n\n\n\nA Markov chain is a type of stochastic process where the distribution of future states depends only on the current state and not on the sequence of events that preceded it. For example, the outcome for X_t depends only on what the outcome was for X_{t-1}. Notice that sometimes, authors with specify that X is a Markov chain stochastic process by writing X_n instead of X_t.\nThe figure on the left shows a state transition diagram for a discrete-time Markov chain with transition probabilities p_{ij} = \\mathbb{P}(X_{n+1}= j\\ \\lvert\\ X_n = i). Below the diagram is the matrix representation of these interactions, known as the transition matrix, \\mathbf{P}, where each row is a probability mass function. A generalized definition for a Markov chain is given by\n\n\\mathbb{P}(X_n = x\\ \\lvert\\ X_0, \\dots, X_{n-1}) = \\mathbb{P}(X_n = x\\ \\lvert\\ X_{n-1})\n\nfor all n and for all x \\in \\mathcal{X}. Markov chains have many aspects, but for this application, it is essential to consider the properties of a specific transitional stage denoted by, \\pi = (\\pi_i : i \\in \\mathcal{X}). The vector \\pi consists of non-negative numbers that sum to one and is a stationary (or invariant) distribution if \\pi = \\pi\\mathbf{P}.\nBy applying the Chapman-Kolmogorov equations for n-step probabilities, where it is shown that p_{ij}(m+n) = \\sum_k p_{ik}(m) p_{kj}(n), we derive that a key characteristic of a stationary distribution \\pi for a Markov chain is that it is limiting. This means that, after any number of steps n, a distribution that reaches \\pi remains as \\pi:\n\nDraw X_0 from the distribution \\pi gives \\mu_0 = \\pi.\nDraw X_1 from the distribution \\pi gives \\mu_1 = \\mu_0\\mathbf{P} = \\pi\\mathbf{P} = \\pi.\nDraw X_2 from the distribution \\pi gives \\pi\\mathbf{P}^2 = (\\pi\\mathbf{P})\\mathbf{P} = \\pi\\mathbf{P} = \\pi.\n\\dots etc.\n\nHere, \\mu_n(i) = \\mathbb{P}(X_n = i) denotes the marginal probability that the chain is in state i at time n, while \\mu_0 represents the initial distribution. Once the chain limits to the distribution \\pi, it will remain in this distribution indefinitely. However, ensuring the process is stationary is not sufficient; it is also important to guarantee that \\pi is unique. This uniqueness is guaranteed if the Markov chain is ergodic, which must satisfy the following two characteristics 3,5:\n\nAperiodicity: The states do not get trapped in cycles of fixed length. This means revisiting any state does not happen at regular intervals, ensuring more general behavior. For d = \\text{gcd}\\{n\\ :\\ p_{ii}(n) &gt; 0\\} then d(i) = 1, where gcd means “greatest common divisor”.\nPositive Recurrence: The expected number of steps to return to that state is finite. A Markov chain is positive recurrent if every state is positive recurrent.\n\nIf the Markov chain is also irreducible, then all states communicate, meaning it is possible to get from any state to any other state, denoted by i \\leftrightarrow j. Having an irreducible, ergodic Markov chain guarantees that it has a unique stationary distribution, \\pi.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nA Markov chain with a stationary distribution does not mean that it converges.\n\n\nThere is much more to learn about Markov chains beyond what was discussed here, but these fundamental concepts provide a foundation for understanding their use in Monte Carlo methods.\n\n\nMotivation\nTraditionally, Monte Carlo methods rely on independent sampling. However, MCMC methods rely on a dependent Markov sequence with a limiting distribution that corresponds to the distribution we aim to model 1. MCMC has wide-ranging applications and is frequently used in Bayesian inference. However, it is also generalizable to other problems that are not Bayesian in nature 1.\nTo help you understand the connection between Monte Carlo sampling methods and estimating complex analytical solutions using Markov chains, let’s first explore the motivation: initially within the commonly exemplified Bayesian framework, and then in a general sense. Consider the following scenario provided by Wasserman in the context of Bayesian inference where we have a process that generates the random vector X 3. We have the prior distribution f(\\theta) with respect to parameter \\theta and data \\mathbf{X} = (X_1, \\dots, X_n) with a posterior density\n\nf(\\theta\\ \\lvert\\ \\mathbf{X}) = \\frac{\\mathcal{L}(\\theta)\\ f(\\theta)}{\\int \\mathcal{L}(\\theta)\\ f(\\theta)\\ d\\theta}\n\nwhere the denominator is the normalizing constant, here denoted by c. The mean of the posterior is \\begin{align*}\n\\bar{\\theta} &= \\int \\theta\\ f(\\theta\\ \\lvert\\ \\mathbf{X})\\ d\\theta \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{c} \\int \\theta\\ \\mathcal{L}(\\theta)\\ f(\\theta)\\ d\\theta\n\\end{align*}\nIf the parameter space is multidimensional, i.e., \\boldsymbol{\\theta} = (\\theta_1, \\dots, \\theta_k), but we are only interested in one component, say \\theta_1, then the marginal posterior density of \\theta_1 is defined as \nf(\\theta_1\\ \\lvert\\ \\mathbf{X}) = \\int\\int\\cdots\\int f(\\theta_1, \\dots, \\theta_k\\ \\lvert\\ \\mathbf{X})\\ d\\theta_2 \\cdots\\ d\\theta_k\n\nAs can easily be seen, it might not always be feasible to calculate this outcome directly. Generally speaking, we have a random vector \\mathbf{X} and we wish to compute E[f(\\mathbf{X})] 1. If the random vector is continuous and associated with the probability density p(\\boldsymbol{x}), then we want to calculate \nE[f(\\mathbf{X})] = \\int f(\\boldsymbol{x})\\ p(\\boldsymbol{x})\\ d\\boldsymbol{x}\n\nThe density p(\\boldsymbol{x}) is often referred to as the target density, representing the distribution of the random variables that are of interest in our study 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMarkov chains are typically reserved for discrete outcomes. However, general applications of MCMC can be used for discrete, continuous, or hybrid outcomes. In this context, Markov chains can be applied to any type of distribution 1.\n\n\nStandard Monte Carlo methods aim to draw n independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples of \\mathbf{X} directly from p(\\boldsymbol{x}), but this is also not always feasible 1. Simple random generation methods require specific restrictions to ensure a solution or might be computationally inefficient in high-dimensional problems. For example, the adaptation of the accept-reject method from Monte Carlo Statistical Methods by Robert and Casella, called adaptive rejection sampling, is restricted to densities that are log-concave and has computational power requirements that are proportional to the fifth power of \\text{dim}(\\mathbf{X}) 1,6.\nCanonical Monte Carlo approaches are more restrictive than is necessary to estimate E[f(\\mathbf{X})]. Leveraging Markov chain-based schemes avoids the necessity of sampling directly from p(\\boldsymbol{x}); instead, dependent sequences with a limiting distribution of p(\\boldsymbol{x}) are used 1.\nRecall that in the previous section, we showed that a Markov chain that is irreducible and ergodic is guaranteed to have a unique stationary distribution, \\pi 3. This is a consequence of the ergodic theorem, which guarantees that the normalized sum below will approach the mean of f(\\mathbf{X}), with convergence in mean square (m.s.) or almost surely (a.s.) as n \\rightarrow \\infty for any fixed M 1.\n\n\\frac{1}{n-M} \\sum_{k = M+1}^n\\ f(\\mathbf{X}_k)\n\nHere, M is referred to as the “burn-in” period. We know that the dependence of \\mathbf{X}_k on early states, say \\mathbf{X}_0, \\mathbf{X}_1, \\dots, \\mathbf{X}_M, for bounded M &lt; \\infty, disappears as k \\rightarrow \\infty 1. With sufficient burn-in, we achieve the ergodic average that stabilizes at \\pi, and when executed correctly, \\pi equals the target density to within a scalar value 1,3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypes of Convergence\n\n\n\n\n\nThis excerpt summarizes Spall’s Introduction to Stochastic Search and Optimization: Estimation, Simulation, and Control Appendix C.2 Convergence Theory 1.\nFinite-sampled stochastic algorithms are often intractable, justifying the focus on the behavior of stochastic processes in their limit. The type of convergence properties a process has informs us about the scenarios where it is appropriate to apply the theory in practice and provides insight into non-limiting behaviors. Convergence for stochastic algorithms is probabilistic and characterized by measure-theoretic concepts, often classified into the following four types:\n\n\\gdef\\norm#1{\\left\\lVert#1\\right\\rVert}\n\nConvergence almost surely: The sequence of random vectors \\mathbf{X}_k \\rightarrow \\mathbf{X} a.s. (or with probability 1)\n\nP\\left(\\omega \\in \\Omega \\ : \\ \\lim_{k \\rightarrow \\infty}\\ \\norm{\\mathbf{X}_k(\\omega) - \\mathbf{X}(\\omega)} = 0\\right) = 1\n\nConvergence in probability: The sequence of random vectors \\mathbf{X}_k \\rightarrow \\mathbf{X} in pr.\n\n\\lim_{k \\rightarrow \\infty} P\\left(\\omega \\in \\Omega \\ : \\ \\norm{\\mathbf{X}_k(\\omega) - \\mathbf{X}(\\omega)} \\geq c\\right) = 0\\ \\ \\ \\text{ for any } c &gt; 0\n\nConvergence in mean square: The sequence of random vectors \\mathbf{X}_k \\rightarrow \\mathbf{X} in m.s.\n\n\\lim_{k \\rightarrow \\infty} E\\left(\\norm{\\mathbf{X}_k(\\omega) - \\mathbf{X}(\\omega)}^2\\right) = 0\n\nConvergence in distribution: The sequence of random vectors \\mathbf{X}_k \\rightarrow \\mathbf{X} in m.s.\n\n\\lim_{k \\rightarrow \\infty} F_{\\mathbf{X}_k}(\\boldsymbol{x}) = F_{\\mathbf{X}}(\\boldsymbol{x})\\ \\ \\ \\text{ at every point } \\boldsymbol{x} \\text{ where } F_{\\mathbf{X}}(\\boldsymbol{x}) \\text{ is continuous.}\n\nwhere \\norm{\\cdot} denotes any valid norm, i.e., the Euclidean norm \\norm{\\boldsymbol{x}} = \\sqrt{\\sum_i x_i^2}, and x_i is the i^{th} component of the vector \\boldsymbol{x}.\n\n\n\nIn the next section, we will show how Gibbs sampling produces the correct mean, computed with respect to our target density p(\\boldsymbol{x}). In summary, we have thus far introduced the basic concepts around Markov chains that simplify random sampling from conditional distributions, which are guaranteed to converge if irreducible and ergodic. With the appropriate burn-in, M, we can ensure the ergodic average stabilizes at \\pi. We now want to show that Gibbs sampling is capable of producing a stabilized limiting distribution, \\pi, that is proportional to our target density p(\\boldsymbol{x}).\n\n\nA Brief Interlude in Probabilistic Graphical Modeling\nThe concept of Gibbs sampling was introduced by Geman and Geman in their paper Stochastic Relaxation, Gibbs Distributions, and the Bayesian Restoration of Images 1,5,7. In their work, they identified the equivalence between Markov random fields and the Gibbs distribution, also known as the Boltzmann distribution, which had been previously used in physical chemistry to relate the probability of a system’s state to its energy and temperature 7,8.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJosiah Gibbs: Yale’s First Engineering Ph.D. and Chair of Mathematical Physics\n\n\n\nGibbs sampling is named after the American mechanical engineer and scientist, Josiah Willard Gibbs, who received the first Ph.D. in engineering in the United States in 1863 from Yale University. He was also appointed the first chair of mathematical physics in the United States at Yale, and contributed to many areas in physics, chemistry, and mathematics. Gibbs is credited with laying the foundation for the field of physical chemistry 5,9.\n\n\nFundamentally, this is why Gibbs sampling has a natural intuition tied to graphical modeling, a broader subject that we will only lightly touch upon in this week’s concept. Some sources attempt to explain Gibbs sampling outside of the graphical model framework, but the more comprehensive ones will acknowledge this connection. It is beyond our scope to bring students entirely up to speed with graphical theory, so additional reading has been provided earlier to help bridge this gap if readers find any of the content too advanced.\nIn practice, especially in medical diagnosis problems, there may be hundreds of attributes that contribute to the joint probability distribution for a given disease 2. Furthermore, some of these distributions may overlap or have similarities with those of other diseases, making them challenging to separate using standard probabilistic approaches. Probabilistic graphical models are graph-based representations of variable interactions, which can help to succinctly represent these interactions in digestible pieces despite their high dimensionality 2.\nMore impressively, graphical modeling encodes interaction attributes such as independencies, factorization, pathways, and message propagation. This not only provides an intuitive understanding of complex interactions but also allows for the exploitation of these features for inference and efficient computation 2,5. Shown below are two fundamental ways in which variables and their relationships with one another can be represented: a Bayesian network, also referred to as a Directed Graph, and a Markov network, also known as an Undirected Graph.\n\n\n\nModified version of Figure 1.1 from Probabilistic Graphical Models by Koller and Friedman 2.\n\n\nThe key concept exemplified by the figure above is independence properties. These can differ for the same graph depending on whether the relationships between variables are defined as directed or undirected, but ultimately allow for factorization representing these independence assertions. The notation differences for factorized joint distributions, shown at the bottom of the figure, are used to differentiate the types of dependency structures implied by the graph itself.\nBy definition, the Markov network factorization is a Gibbs distribution parameterized by the set of factors \\Phi = {\\phi(A, B), \\phi(B, C), \\phi(C, D), \\phi(A, D)} with the normalizing constant called the partition function\n\nZ = \\sum_{X_1, \\dots, X_n}\\ \\tilde{P}_{\\Phi}(X_1, \\dots, X_n)\n where \\tilde{P}_{\\Phi} represents the joint distribution factorized into conditional probabilities based on its independencies 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFactor \\neq Marginal\n\n\n\nA factor is one contribution to the overall joint distribution, while a marginal represents a distribution where at least one variable from the joint has been summed or integrated out 2.\n\n\nAlthough we have discussed Markov chains earlier and provided the explicit definition of a Gibbs distribution in the context of probabilistic graphical modeling, this does not imply that Gibbs sampling is exclusively applicable to undirected graphs 5. How the differences affect Gibbs sampling is discussed in the next section.\n\n\nGibbs Sampling\nIn the M-H algorithm, we start with a proposed distribution, q(\\cdot\\ \\lvert x), from which we can sample, but which is not directly the target distribution, p(\\boldsymbol{x}). In many cases, it may be chosen arbitrarily, as long as its limiting behaviors converge to the target distribution 1. For MCMC conducted using the M-H algorithm to work, we need to ensure \\pi satisfies detailed balance, where the probability of transitioning from state i to j must be equal to the probability of the reverse transition when multiplied by their respective stationary distribution probabilities 3.\n\n\\pi_i p_{ij} = \\pi_j p_{ji}\n\nAt each step in the algorithm, a candidate point is drawn from the proposal distribution, denoted using the random variable \\mathbf{W}. Assuming that this proposal distribution satisfies detailed balance and is a superset of the points for the target distribution (ensuring they are fully supported), then candidate draws are kept or discarded with probability \\rho(\\mathbf{X}_k, \\mathbf{W}) 1\n\n\\rho(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{w}) = \\min\\left\\{\\frac{p(\\boldsymbol{w})}{p(\\boldsymbol{x})} \\frac{q(\\boldsymbol{x}\\ \\lvert\\ \\boldsymbol{w})}{q(\\boldsymbol{w}\\ \\lvert\\ \\boldsymbol{x})},\\ 1\\right\\}\n\nIf a candidate point is accepted, then \\mathbf{X}_{k+1} = \\mathbf{W}; otherwise, \\mathbf{X}_{k+1} = \\mathbf{X}_k 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhen samples from the Markov chain start to resemble the target distribution, it is said to be “mixing well” 3. Tweaking the parameters used in the proposed distribution to support good mixing is not always straightforward and may require some trial-and-error troubleshooting; refer to example 24.10 from Wasserman’s All of Statistics for an illustration of this.\n\n\nGibbs sampling is much like M-H, but it is a special case where the proposal distribution comes directly from the conditional factorizations of p(\\boldsymbol{x}) itself. In a sense, it can be thought of as m M-H algorithms working together, where each proposed distribution is one conditional factorization of p(\\boldsymbol{x}) 1. In this context, m represents the number of random variables, each having its own conditional distribution for sampling. Consider the following scenario from Spall where we have a distribution p_{X,Y,Z}(\\cdot) that we wish to sample from:\n\nStart with an initial guess for Y and Z and sample from p_{X \\mid Y_0, Z_0}(x \\mid Y_0, Z_0) to generate X_1.\nAccept the outcome from the previous step and sample from p_{Y \\mid X_1, Z_0}(y \\mid X_1, Z_0) to generate Y_1.\nAccept the outcome from the previous step and sample from p_{Z \\mid X_1, Y_1}(z \\mid X_1, Y_1) to generate Z_1.\nRepeat the process until you have n-1 values for X and n values for Y and Z.\n\nAt the end of this process, you will have produced the Gibbs sequence. For the example above, we produce:\n\nY_0, Z_0;\\ X_1, Y_1, Z_1;\\ X_2, Y_2, Z_2;\\ \\dots; X_n, Y_n, Z_n\n\nThe process described above is iterated over all variables and conditional statements until it is possible to compute the ergodic average. According to the ergodic theorem, this occurs when a sufficient burn-in period has been allowed to run. Using the example above, if we set our burn-in period to M &lt; n, then the appended Gibbs sequence {X_{M+1}, Y_{M+1}, Z_{M+1}; \\dots; X_n, Y_n, Z_n} represents measurements that converge in distribution as n \\rightarrow \\infty to the unique, stationary distribution \\pi, that is p_{X,Y,Z}(\\cdot) 1.\nFinally, the Gibbs sequence results considering the burn-in are substituded into the following equation to give E[f(X,Y,Z)]\n\n\\frac{1}{n-M} \\sum_{k = M+1}^n\\ f(\\mathbf{X}_k)\n\nNotice that samplings for X, Y, and Z will converge to their respective marginal distributions, p_X(x), p_Y(y), and p_Z(z); see Section 7.1.3 from Monte Carlo Statistical Methods by Robert and Casella 1,6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariations that make the Gibbs sequence resemble i.i.d.\n\n\n\nThe procedure we have detailed here to estimate the distribution using the collected Gibbs sequence is one of several methods. As might be expected, successive samples drawn from the Markov chain are highly correlated with one another 5. Different approaches are applied if it is desirable to make the values more i.i.d. You can learn more about some of these techniques in Introduction to Stochastic Search and Optimization: Estimation, Simulation, and Control, Section 16.3 Gibbs Sampling by Spall 1.\n\n\nBecause we are drawing from the conditioned factors of the target distribution, this makes Gibbs sampling less generalizable than M-H, but it comes with advantageous trade-offs. For instance, drawing directly from the target distribution itself ensures that detailed balance is already satisfied, and the algorithm is expected to be more efficient because the new point is always accepted 1,2,5.\nIt is helpful to see the process illustrated for a simpler case, but for completeness, it’s important to know how this extends to a generalized representation. The following is the generalized definition provided by Spall 1. Say that \\mathbf{X} is a collection of m univariate components, then the k^{th} sample from X using the previous algorithm is\n\n\\mathbf{X}_k = \\left[ \\begin{array}{c}\nX_{k1} \\\\\nX_{k2} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nX_{km}\n\\end{array} \\right]\n\nwhere X_{ki} is the i^{th} component for the k^{th} replicate of \\mathbf{X} that was generated using Gibbs sampling. Denote the step-wise updating results that have been conditioned on the previous samples by \\{X_{k+1,\\ i}\\ \\lvert\\ \\mathbf{X}_{k\\backslash i}\\} where\n\n\\mathbf{X}_{k\\backslash i}\\ \\equiv \\{X_{k+1,\\ 1},\\ X_{k+1,\\ 2}, \\dots, X_{k+1,\\ i-1},\\ X_{k,\\ i+1} \\dots,\\ X_{k,\\ km}\\}\n\nfor i = 1,\\ 2, \\dots,\\ m. Use {X_{k+1,\\ i} \\mid \\mathbf{X}{k\\backslash i}} \\sim p_i(x \\mid \\mathbf{X}{k\\backslash i}) to represent the sampling density for that random variable conditioned on the current elements of the Gibbs sequence, where i-1 elements are sample points at iteration k+1 and the remaining m-i elements are from the k^{th} iteration. The Gibbs sampling algorithm is as follows:\n\n(Initialization) Choose the length of the burn-in, M, and some arbitrary initial state \\mathbf{X}_0 with k=0.\nGenerate \\mathbf{X}_{k+1} by recursively updating the conditionals for each new sampling of a given variable.\n\nGenerate X_{k+1,\\ 1} \\sim p_1(x\\ \\lvert\\ \\mathbf{X}_{k\\backslash 1})\nGenerate X_{k+1,\\ 2} \\sim p_2(x\\ \\lvert\\ \\mathbf{X}_{k\\backslash 2})\n\n              \\vdots\n\nGenerate X_{k+1,\\ m} \\sim p_m(x\\ \\lvert\\ \\mathbf{X}_{k\\backslash m})\n\nRepeat step 2 until the burn-in is reached. Set \\mathbf{X}_k = \\mathbf{X}_M and continue with the procedure laid out in step 2, storing or recursively averaging the results as they are sampled.\nWhen it is possible to compute the ergodic average (i.e. sufficient convergence is observed), then estimate E[f(\\mathbf{X})] for the target distribution p(\\cdot).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtension to the multivariate case\n\n\n\nWe are only focusing on the typical case where X_{ki} is scalar (i.e., all components of X are univariate). It is sometimes applicable to make them multivariate. Students who wish to explore this further are encouraged to review example 16.7 Variance-components model from Section 16.6 Applications in Bayesian Analysis in Spall’s Introduction to Stochastic Search and Optimization: Estimation, Simulation, and Control 1.\n\n\nWhen sampling from the conditional distribution is challenging or requires excessive computational power, the conditional properties associated with a distribution network graph can help 2. Depending on the type of associations defined, it might be possible to isolate variables from the rest of the network using its independence structures, assuming that these assertions are reasonably correct.\nFor an undirected Markov network, this would involve isolating nodes contained within a Markov blanket. In directed graphs, nodes conditioned on their parents can lead to log-concave Gibbs sampling distributions. If these conditional distributions are log-concave, alternative sampling methods, such as the aforementioned adaptive rejection sampling method, can be used within the Gibbs sampling framework 5,6.\nWith this fundamental understanding of Gibbs sampling of Markov chains, we are now better prepared to explore hierarchical modeling of our data."

If it does not already exist, create the file path using the following code.\n\n\nCommand-Line Application\n\n# ONLY IF there is no existing directory\nsudo mkdir -p /usr/local/lib\n\nCreate a symbolic link from the Homebrew-installed libjags.4.dylib JAGS library to the expected location:\n\n\nCommand-Line Application\n\nsudo ln -s /opt/homebrew/lib/libjags.4.dylib /usr/local/lib/libjags.4.dylib\n\nCreate another symbolic link for the Homebrew-installed JAGS modules directory to the expected location:\n\n\nCommand-Line Application\n\nsudo mkdir -p /usr/local/lib/JAGS/modules-4\nsudo ln -s /opt/homebrew/lib/JAGS/modules-4/* /usr/local/lib/JAGS/modules-4/\n\nOPTIONAL: You can verify the linking worked if you see the intended directory listed for both of the following lines of code.\n\n\nCommand-Line Application\n\n# Running both should NOT give you \"No such file or directory\"\nls -l /usr/local/lib/libjags.4.dylib\nls -l /usr/local/lib/JAGS/modules-4/\n\nReinstalling rjags with the connection in place.\n\n\nRStudio\n\n# Remove existing installation\nremove.packages(\"rjags\")\n\n# Reinstall rjags\ninstall.packages(\"rjags\")\n\n# Load the package\nlibrary(rjags)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis page was developed on a Mac, and so the directions for a PC were not able to be tested.\n\n\n\nFrom JAGS, open the download link that will take you to a SourceForge page.\nDownload the latest version. At the time of this writing, the current version is JAGS-4.3.2.\nOpen and run the downloaded installer.\nYou will need to also download the latest version of RTools, which at the time of this writing is RTools 4.5. Add Rtools to your PATH if it is not done automatically.\n\n\nCommand-Line Application\n\nwhere make   # Should give the result \"C:\\Rtools\\bin\\make.exe\"\necho %PATH%  # Should give the result \"C:\\Rtools\\bin;C:\\Rtools\\mingw_64\\bin\"\n\nIf this does not give the expected results, you can set the path:\n\n\nCommand-Line Application\n\n# ONLY IF the PATH for Rtools is incorrect.\nsetx PATH \"%PATH%;C:\\Rtools\\bin;C:\\Rtools\\mingw_64\\bin\"\n\nConfirm that the installation is located where we need it to be: C:\\Program Files\\JAGS\\JAGS-4.x\\bin.\n\n\nCommand-Line Application\n\necho %JAGS_HOME%  # Should say \"C:\\Program Files\\JAGS\\JAGS-4.x\"\necho %PATH%       # Should say \"...;C:\\Program Files\\JAGS\\JAGS-4.x\\bin;...\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the namespace load failed\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes the installer might place the JAGS program in a different location. If this happens, you can set the file path in the command line application as follows and retry installing the package through R.\n\nModify the environment variables as needed.\n\n\nCommand-Line Application\n\nsetx JAGS_HOME \"C:\\Program Files\\JAGS\\JAGS-4.x\"\nsetx PATH \"%PATH%;C:\\Program Files\\JAGS\\JAGS-4.x\\bin\"\n\nOPTIONAL: You can verify the setting worked.\n\n\nCommand-Line Application\n\necho %JAGS_HOME%  # Should say \"C:\\Program Files\\JAGS\\JAGS-4.x\"\necho %PATH%       # Should say \"...;C:\\Program Files\\JAGS\\JAGS-4.x\\bin;...\"\n\nReinstalling rjags with the connection in place.\n\n\nRStudio\n\n# Remove existing installation\nremove.packages(\"rjags\")\n\n# Reinstall rjags\ninstall.packages(\"rjags\")\n\n# Load the package\nlibrary(rjags)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith JAGS installed, we can now proceed with the standard process of installing the necessary packages.

Serotyping is done by GNRCS using the samples provided by these laboratories, and incidences are reported as cases per 100,000 using the age-specific population in Germany in 2018 10.\n\n\n# Read in the cleaned data directly from the instructor's GitHub.\ndf &lt;- read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ysph-dsde/bdsy-phm/refs/heads/main/Data/testDE2.csv\")\n\n# Summarize the variable names included in the dataset.\ncolnames(df)\n\n [1] \"...1\"                             \"Sequencial.number\"               \n [3] \"Study\"                            \"Number\"                          \n [5] \"Inclusion\"                        \"DateOfIsolation\"                 \n [7] \"DateOfBirth\"                      \"AgeInYears\"                      \n [9] \"AgeinMonths\"                      \"Postleitzahl.patient\"            \n[11] \"Zip\"                              \"Federal.state.patient\"           \n[13] \"Residence.patient\"                \"Country.patient\"                 \n[15] \"SeroType\"                         \"Strain.identification...Genus\"   \n[17] \"Strain.identification...Species\"  \"Pneumonia\"                       \n[19] \"MD.Amoxicillin\"                   \"AmoxicillinSNS\"                  \n[21] \"MD.Cefotaxime\"                    \"CefotaximeSNS\"                   \n[23] \"MD.Chloramphenicol\"               \"ChloramphenicolSNS\"              \n[25] \"MD.Clindamycin\"                   \"ClindamycinSNS\"                  \n[27] \"MD.Erythromycin\"                  \"ErythromycinSNS\"                 \n[29] \"MD.Levofloxacin\"                  \"LevofloxaxinSNS\"                 \n[31] \"MD.Penicillin\"                    \"PenicillinSNS\"                   \n[33] \"MD.Tetracyclin\"                   \"TetracyclineSNS\"                 \n[35] \"MD.Trimetoprim.Sulfamethoxazole\"  \"Sulfamethoxazole.trimethoprimSNS\"\n[37] \"MD.Vancomycin\"                    \"VancomycinSNS\"                   \n[39] \"date\"                             \"year\"                            \n[41] \"month\"                            \"epiyr\"                           \n[43] \"agec\"                             \"vt\"                              \n[45] \"vaxperiod\"                        \"zip2\"                            \n[47] \"indic\"                           \n\n\n\nThe dataset includes a lot of information that is not required for our analysis today.

   abstract = {Background: The population impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) depends on direct and indirect protection. Following Malawi's introduction of the 13-valent PCV (PCV13) in 2011, we examined its impact on vaccine and non-vaccine serotype invasive pneumococcal disease among vaccine-eligible-age and vaccine-ineligible-age children and adults. Methods: We did a prospective observational time-series analysis and a case-control study. We used data from between Jan 1, 2006, and Dec 31, 2018, from laboratory-based surveillance at a government hospital in Malawi. This period included 6 years before and 7 years after introduction of PCV13. By use of negative-binomial regression, we evaluated secular trend-adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) in vaccine serotype and non-vaccine serotype invasive pneumococcal disease before and after introduction of PCV. We compared predicted counterfactual incidence in hypothetical absence of vaccine with empirically observed incidence following vaccine introduction. The case-control study assessed vaccine effectiveness, comparing PCV uptake among cases of vaccine-eligible-age invasive pneumococcal disease versus matched community controls. Findings: Surveillance covered 10 281 476 person-years of observation, with 140 498 blood and 63 291 cerebrospinal fluid cultures. A reduction in total (vaccine serotype plus non-vaccine serotype) invasive pneumococcal disease incidence preceded introduction of PCV: 19\% (IRR 0·81, 95\% CI 0·74 to 0·88, p<0·0001) among infants (<1 year old), 14\% (0·86, 0·80 to 0·93, p<0·0001) among children aged 1–4 years, and 8\% (0·92, 0·83 to 1·01, p=0·084) among adolescents and adults (≥15 years old). Among children aged 5–14 years there was a 2\% increase in total invasive pneumococcal disease (1·02, 0·93 to 1·11, p=0·72). Compared with the counterfactually predicted incidence, incidence of post-PCV13 vaccine serotype invasive pneumococcal disease was 74\% (95\% CI 70 to 78) lower among children aged 1–4 years and 79\% (76 to 83) lower among children aged 5–14 years, but only 38\% (37 to 40) lower among infants and 47\% (44 to 51) lower among adolescents and adults. Although non-vaccine serotype invasive pneumococcal disease has increased in incidence since 2015, observed incidence remains low. The case-control study (19 cases and 76 controls) showed vaccine effectiveness against vaccine serotype invasive pneumococcal disease of 80·7\% (–73·7 to 97·9). Interpretation: In a high-mortality, high-HIV-prevalence setting in Africa, there were significant pre-vaccine reductions in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease. 7 years after PCV introduction, although vaccine-attributable impact among vaccine-eligible-age children was significant, indirect effects benefitting unvaccinated infants and adults were not. Policy decisions should consider multiple alternative strategies for reducing disease burden, including targeted vaccination outside infant Expanded Programme of Immunization to benefit vulnerable populations.

   abstract = {In 2022, 17 700 confirmed cases of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) were reported in the European Union/European Economic Area. The crude notification rate was 5.1 cases per 100 000 population, similar to 2018 and 2019. Age-specific rates were highest in infants under one year old (13.4 confirmed cases per 100 000 population) and in adults 65 years old and above (12.6 confirmed cases per 100 000 population), with higher rates reported in males than females among all age groups. The most common serotypes were 3, 8, 19A, 22F, 6C, 23B, 9N, 4, 23A 11A, and 15A (in order of decreasing frequency), accounting for 73.9\% of typed isolates. Of cases under five years old for whom serotype information was available, approximately 46\% were caused by a serotype included in the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13). This proportion has increased over the last five years. Among cases 65 years old and above, approximately 71\% of cases with serotype information available were caused by serotypes included in the 23-valent polysaccharide},

   abstract = {Background: Pneumococcus is a diverse pathogen, with >90 serotypes, each of which has a distinct polysaccharide capsule. Pneumococci can switch capsules, evading vaccine pressure. Certain serotype pairs are more likely to occur on the same genetic background as a results of serotype switching, but the drivers of these patterns are not well understood. Methods: We used the PubMLST and Global Pneumococcal Sequencing Project databases to quantify the number of genetic lineages on which different serotype pairs occur together. We also quantified the genetic diversity of each serotype. Regression model were used to evaluate the relationship between shared polysaccharide components and the frequency of serotype co-occurrence and diversity. Results: A number of serotype pairs occurred together on the same genetic lineage more commonly than expected. Co-occurrence of between-serogroup pairs was more common when both serotypes had glucose as a component of the capsule (and, potentially, glucuronic acid, any-N-acetylated sugar, or ribitol). Diversity also varied markedly by serotype and was associated with the presence of specific sugars in the capsule. Conclusions: Certain pairs of serotypes are more likely to co-occur on the same genetic background. These patterns were correlated with shared polysaccharide components. This might reflect adaptation of strains to produce capsules with specific characteristics.},

   abstract = {Background: Carriage studies are an efficient means for assessing pneumococcal conjugate vaccine effect in settings where pneumococcal disease surveillance programmes are not well established. In this study the effect of 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) introduction on pneumococcal carriage and density among Nepalese children using a bacterial microarray and qPCR was examined. Methods: PCV10 was introduced into the Nepalese infant immunisation schedule in August 2015. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from healthy Nepalese children in Kathmandu between April 2014 and December 2021. Samples were plated on blood agar, incubated overnight, and DNA extracted from plate sweeps. Pneumococcal serotyping was done using the Senti-SPv1.5 microarray (BUGS Bioscience, UK). DNA was extracted from swab media and qPCR performed for pneumococcal autolysin (lytA). Results: A significant decline in prevalence of PCV10 serotypes was observed when comparing pre-PCV10 with post-PCV10 collection periods (36.5 \%, 454/1244 vs 10.3 \%, 243/2353, p < 0.0001). Multiple-serotype carriage was also observed to significantly decline when comparing pre-PCV10 with post-PCV10 periods (31.4 \%, 390/1244 vs 22.2 \%, 522/2353, p < 0.0001). Additionally, a significant decline in median pneumococcal density was observed when comparing pre-PCV10 with post-PCV10 periods (3.3 vs 3.25 log10 GE/ml, p = 0.0196). Conclusions: PCV10 introduction was associated with reduced, prevalence of all PCV10 serotypes, multiple serotype carriage, and pneumococcal carriage density.},

   abstract = {Invasive pneumococcal disease is one of the major causes of death in young children in resource poor countries. Nasopharyngeal carriage studies provide insight into the local prevalence of circulating pneumococcal serotypes. There are very few data on the concurrent carriage of multiple pneumococcal serotypes. This study aimed to identify the prevalence and serotype distribution of pneumococci carried in the nasopharynx of young healthy Nepalese children prior to the introduction of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine using a microarray-based molecular serotyping method capable of detecting multi-serotype carriage. We conducted a cross-sectional study of healthy children aged 6 weeks to 24 months from the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal between May and October 2012. Nasopharyngeal swabs were frozen and subsequently plated on selective culture media. DNA extracts of plate sweeps of pneumococcal colonies from these cultures were analysed using a molecular serotyping microarray capable of detecting relative abundance of multiple pneumococcal serotypes. 600 children were enrolled into the study: 199 aged 6 weeks to <6 months, 202 aged 6 months to < 12 months, and 199 aged 12 month to 24 months. Typeable pneumococci were identified in 297/600 (49·5\%) of samples with more than one serotype being found in 67/297 (20·2\%) of these samples. The serotypes covered by the thirteen-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine were identified in 44·4\% of samples containing typeable pneumococci. Application of a molecular serotyping approach to identification of multiple pneumococcal carriage demonstrates a substantial prevalence of co-colonisation. Continued surveillance utilising this approach following the introduction of routine use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccinates in infants will provide a more accurate understanding of vaccine efficacy against carriage and a better understanding of the dynamics of subsequent serotype and genotype replacement.},

   abstract = {Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines target 10 or 13 specific serotypes. To evaluate the overall efficacy of these products, the vaccine-targeted serotypes are typically aggregated into a single group. However, it is often desirable to evaluate variations in effects for different serotypes. These serotype-specific estimates are often based on small counts, resulting in a high degree of uncertainty (i.e., large standard errors and wide confidence intervals). An alternative is to use a hierarchical Bayesian statistical model, which estimates overall effectiveness while simultaneously providing estimates of serotype-specific vaccine effects. These shrunken serotype-specific estimators often have smaller mean squared errors (MSEs) than unbiased versions due to a large decrease in posterior uncertainty. We reanalyzed published data from a randomized controlled trial on the efficacy of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) against community-acquired pneumonia caused by vaccine-targeted serotype using a hierarchical model. This model provides a potential framework for obtaining estimates of serotype-specific vaccine effects with reduced MSEs.},

   abstract = {Background. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) have had a well-documented impact on the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). However, declines in IPD due to vaccine-targeted serotypes have been partially offset by increases in IPD due to nonvaccine serotypes (NVTs). The goal of this study was to quantify serotype-specific changes in the incidence of IPD that occurred in different age groups, with or without certain comorbidities, following the introduction of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in the childhood vaccination program in Denmark. Methods. We used nationwide surveillance data for IPD and a hierarchical Bayesian regression framework to estimate changes in the incidence of IPD associated with the introduction of PCV7 (2007) and PCV13 (2010) while controlling for serotype-specific epidemic cycles and unrelated secular trends. Results. Following the introduction of PCV7 and PCV13 in children, the net impact of serotype replacement varied considerably by age group and comorbidities. Differences in the magnitude of serotype replacement were due to variations in the incidence of NVTs in the different risk groups before the introduction of PCVs. The relative increases in the incidence of IPD caused by specific NVTs did not differ appreciably between risk groups in the postvaccination period. Serotype replacement offset a greater proportion of the benefit of PCVs in strata in which the NVTs comprised a larger proportion of cases prior to the introduction of the vaccines. Conclusions. These findings could help to predict the impact of next-generation PCVs in specific risk groups.},

## Codespaces

### Weekly Modules

Please download the codespaces provided for each weekly module release. Note that you may need to adjust the filepath for some references inside the code. It is recommended that you use the starter codespace package, which includes the following:

- An `Rproj` file to set your root directory.
- An `renv` lockfile.
- A suggested `.gitignore`.
- A `README.md` file with directions for using the codespace and guidelines for adding the code to your own GitHub remote repository.

Subsequent weekly releases should be placed inside your root project directory. For instance, if you are using the directory "~/bdsy-phm-individual", place the weekly releases within that directory.

## Research Like a Pro

It is vital that you keep track of and disclose all the references you use to support your research. There are many tools available to help you with this, so discuss with your team and decide on a preferred method for reference tracking.

In my research, I use [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/search/), which comes with a Web Importer plug-in that makes it easy to compile different types of references. It conveniently formats these entries to various styles, including LaTeX and BibTeX.

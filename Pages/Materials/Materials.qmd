## Codespaces

### Weekly Modules

Please download the codespaces provided for each weekly module release. Note that you may need to adjust the filepath for some references inside the code. It is recommended that you use the starter codespace package, which includes the following:

- An `Rproj` file to set your root directory.
- An `renv` lockfile.
- A suggested `.gitignore`.
- A `README.md` file with directions for using the codespace and guidelines for adding the code to your own GitHub remote repository.

Subsequent weekly releases should be placed inside your root project directory. For instance, if you are using the directory "~/bdsy-phm-individual", place the weekly releases within that directory.

### Project Datasets and Materials

Each group will be assigned data from one of three countries: Malawi, Nepal, or Peru. The datasets include the incidence of pneumococcal-caused respiratory disease, or in some cases, any causes of pneumonia, along with Global Pneumococcal Sequencing Project (GPS) metadata for genomic analysis using the [GPS pipeline](https://www.pneumogen.net/gps/#/resources#gps-pipeline)\ [@GPS]. Below, you will find these datasets, the source documentation or papers from which they were obtained, and any ancillary documentation, such as a Data Dictionary.

:::{.callout-note}
Not all sources provided a Data Dictionary, so students will need to explain their variables using the context provided by the source documentation.

## Research Like a Pro

It is vital that you keep track of and disclose all the references you use to support your research. There are many tools available to help you with this, so discuss with your team and decide on a preferred method for reference tracking.

In my research, I use [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/search/), which comes with a Web Importer plug-in that makes it easy to compile different types of references. It conveniently formats these entries to various styles, including LaTeX and BibTeX.

   abstract = {Pattern recognition has its origins in engineering, whereas machine learning grew out of computer science. However, these activities can be viewed as two facets of the same field, and together they have undergone substantial development over the past ten years. In particular, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic models. Also, the practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced through the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation pro- gation. Similarly, new models based on kernels have had significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This new textbook reacts these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first year PhD students, as wellas researchers and practitioners, and assumes no previous knowledge of pattern recognition or - chine learning concepts. Knowledge of multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some familiarity with probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory.},

   abstract = {Next-generation pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) have been approved for use. The serotype distribution of pneumococcal isolates can vary between regions. To understand the potential impacts of new PCVs, we evaluated trends in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) among adults in Germany at a local level using Bayesian hierarchical logistic regression. There was little spatial variation in IPD cases caused by 13-valent PCV serotypes, which dropped from 60\% of IPD cases in 2006 to 30\% in 2018. More than half of IPD cases in 2018 were attributable to serotypes covered by new PCVs (15-valent and 20-valent PCVs), which suggests they could further reduce the burden of IPD.},

   abstract = {We make an analogy between images and statistical mechanics systems. Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios.},

   abstract = {A general framework for constructing and using probabilistic models of complex systems that would enable a computer to use available information for making decisions.

Most tasks require a person or an automated system to reason—to reach conclusions based on available information. The framework of probabilistic graphical models, presented in this book, provides a general approach for this task. The approach is model-based, allowing interpretable models to be constructed and then manipulated by reasoning algorithms. These models can also be learned automatically from data, allowing the approach to be used in cases where manually constructing a model is difficult or even impossible. Because uncertainty is an inescapable aspect of most real-world applications, the book focuses on probabilistic models, which make the uncertainty explicit and provide models that are more faithful to reality.

Probabilistic Graphical Models discusses a variety of models, spanning Bayesian networks, undirected Markov networks, discrete and continuous models, and extensions to deal with dynamical systems and relational data. For each class of models, the text describes the three fundamental cornerstones: representation, inference, and learning, presenting both basic concepts and advanced techniques. Finally, the book considers the use of the proposed framework for causal reasoning and decision making under uncertainty. The main text in each chapter provides the detailed technical development of the key ideas. Most chapters also include boxes with additional material: skill boxes, which describe techniques; case study boxes, which discuss empirical cases related to the approach described in the text, including applications in computer vision, robotics, natural language understanding, and computational biology; and concept boxes, which present significant concepts drawn from the material in the chapter. Instructors (and readers) can group chapters in various combinations, from core topics to more technically advanced material, to suit their particular needs.},

We develop optimization methods which would lead to the best wafer release policy in the chamber tool to maximize the overall yield of the wafers in semiconductor manufacturing system. Since chamber degradation will jeopardize wafer yields, chamber maintenance is taken into account for the wafer sequence decision-making process. Furthermore, genetic algorithm is modified for solving the scheduling problems in this paper. As results, it has been shown that job scheduling has to be managed based on the chamber degradation condition and maintenance activities to maximize overall wafer yield. © 2012 Seungchul Lee and Jun Ni.},

   abstract = {Background: The incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) decreased worldwide in 2020 and the first quarter of 2021, concurrent with nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) intended to stymie transmission of SARS-CoV-2. In 2021, the stringency of these NPI strategies has varied. We investigated age- and serotype-specific variations in IPD case counts in Germany in 2020-2021. Methods: IPD cases through 30 November 2021 were stratified by age group, serotype, or geographic location. IPD surveillance data in 2020-2021 were compared with (1) IPD surveillance data from 2015-2019, (2) mobility data during 2020 and 2021, and (3) NPI stringency data in 2020 and 2021. Results: IPD incidence began to return toward baseline among children 0-4 years old in April 2021 and exceeded baseline by June 2021 (a 9\% increase over the average monthly values for 2015-2019). Children aged 5-14 years and adults aged 15-34 or ≥80 years showed increases in IPD cases that exceeded baseline values starting in July 2021, with increases also starting in spring 2021. The age distribution and proportion of vaccine-serotype IPD remained comparable to those in previous years, despite lower overall case counts in 2020 and 2021. The percentage change in IPD incidence compared with the previous 5 years was correlated with changes in mobility and with NPI stringency. Conclusions: IPD levels began to return to and exceed seasonal levels in spring and summer 2021 in Germany, following sharp declines in 2020 that coincided with NPIs related to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Proportions of vaccine serotypes remained largely consistent throughout 2020-2021.},

   abstract = {Monte Carlo statistical methods, particularly those based on Markov chains, are now an essential component of the standard set of techniques used by statisticians. This new edition has been revised towards a coherent and flowing coverage of these simulation techniques, with incorporation of the most recent developments in the field. In particular, the introductory coverage of random variable generation has been totally revised, with many concepts being unified through a fundamental theorem of simulation

There are five completely new chapters that cover Monte Carlo control, reversible jump, slice sampling, sequential Monte Carlo, and perfect sampling. There is a more in-depth coverage of Gibbs sampling, which is now contained in three consecutive chapters. The development of Gibbs sampling starts with slice sampling and its connection with the fundamental theorem of simulation, and builds up to two-stage Gibbs sampling and its theoretical properties. A third chapter covers the multi-stage Gibbs sampler and its variety of applications. Lastly, chapters from the previous edition have been revised towards easier access, with the examples getting more detailed coverage.

This textbook is intended for a second year graduate course, but will also be useful to someone who either wants to apply simulation techniques for the resolution of practical problems or wishes to grasp the fundamental principles behind those methods. The authors do not assume familiarity with Monte Carlo techniques (such as random variable generation), with computer programming, or with any Markov chain theory (the necessary concepts are developed in Chapter 6). A solutions manual, which covers approximately 40\% of the problems, is available for instructors who require the book for a course.},

   abstract = {Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines target 10 or 13 specific serotypes. To evaluate the overall efficacy of these products, the vaccine-targeted serotypes are typically aggregated into a single group. However, it is often desirable to evaluate variations in effects for different serotypes. These serotype-specific estimates are often based on small counts, resulting in a high degree of uncertainty (i.e., large standard errors and wide confidence intervals). An alternative is to use a hierarchical Bayesian statistical model, which estimates overall effectiveness while simultaneously providing estimates of serotype-specific vaccine effects. These shrunken serotype-specific estimators often have smaller mean squared errors (MSEs) than unbiased versions due to a large decrease in posterior uncertainty. We reanalyzed published data from a randomized controlled trial on the efficacy of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) against community-acquired pneumonia caused by vaccine-targeted serotype using a hierarchical model. This model provides a potential framework for obtaining estimates of serotype-specific vaccine effects with reduced MSEs.},

   abstract = {Background. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) have had a well-documented impact on the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). However, declines in IPD due to vaccine-targeted serotypes have been partially offset by increases in IPD due to nonvaccine serotypes (NVTs). The goal of this study was to quantify serotype-specific changes in the incidence of IPD that occurred in different age groups, with or without certain comorbidities, following the introduction of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in the childhood vaccination program in Denmark. Methods. We used nationwide surveillance data for IPD and a hierarchical Bayesian regression framework to estimate changes in the incidence of IPD associated with the introduction of PCV7 (2007) and PCV13 (2010) while controlling for serotype-specific epidemic cycles and unrelated secular trends. Results. Following the introduction of PCV7 and PCV13 in children, the net impact of serotype replacement varied considerably by age group and comorbidities. Differences in the magnitude of serotype replacement were due to variations in the incidence of NVTs in the different risk groups before the introduction of PCVs. The relative increases in the incidence of IPD caused by specific NVTs did not differ appreciably between risk groups in the postvaccination period. Serotype replacement offset a greater proportion of the benefit of PCVs in strata in which the NVTs comprised a larger proportion of cases prior to the introduction of the vaccines. Conclusions. These findings could help to predict the impact of next-generation PCVs in specific risk groups.},

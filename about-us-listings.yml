        Associate Research Scientist in Epidemiology (Microbial Diseases)
      bio: |
        The surveillance and epidemiology of vaccine-preventable respiratory diseases, especially pneumococcal disease, is my passion. I want to determine how to efficiently and effectively protect populations from pneumococcal disease, both invasive (bacteremia, meningitis) and non-invasive (otitis media, non-bacteremic pneumonia). I'm interested in respiratory disease surveillance, serotype replacement, antibiotic resistance, vulnerable populations, vaccine schedules, vaccine advocacy, and overcoming vaccine hesitancy.
